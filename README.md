Task Details:

Car Class: Initially I have created a class Car with the attributes of id, Make, Model, Year of manufacture, Color, Price, Registration number. In this class, I have created default and parameterized constructors. Moreover, this class contains all the getter setters of the attributes because I made them private and there is a toString() override function added that will create a string of all the attributes that can be used to store in a file later on.

File Manager: There is another class created with the name of File Manager that will handle all the file storage management and use different functions to store different cars data in different files.

Car Handling: Main caller function is written in the Car Handling class that contains the array of car objects and then according to the requirement of the assignment, I have called three different functions of the file manager class to store different cars data in three different files. I also pushed the output files in the git, you can find it in the AssignmentThree project folder by the names of “CarsByBrand.txt”, “CarsByAgeAndModel.txt” and “CarsByPriceAndYear.txt”.
